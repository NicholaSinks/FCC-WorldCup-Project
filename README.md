This is a FreeCodeCamp Relational Database Project that was required to be completed in order to get the certification.

You can see three files. Here's an explanation of them:
`insert_data.sh` Takes data from a csv file and uses PostgreSQL commands to create a database from this data.
`queries.sh` uses PostgreSQL commands to query the database for specific information about the data.
`worldcup.sql` is a SQL dump of the database.

This project passed all of FreeCodeCamp's tests and was marked completed.
